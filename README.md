Only mask files are shared here due to data size limit on Github (<25 MB). To find all the tissue parameters for the exemplary phantoms (speed of sound, attenuation, density, optical absorption coefficient, reduced scattering coefficient, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio), please visit (https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ywu115_jh_edu/EgLWsSSNk3FPu9GYCvkFeaEBahB1DLQsMANPUzAjoU9mMA?e=EqMF1O).
